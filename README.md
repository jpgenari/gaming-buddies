# Gaming Buddies

Gaming Buddies is a website born to help gamers in Dublin and surroundings to find other gamers with either similar or different interests to chat about their favourite games, consoles, new releases and most important, to play together in a healthy and respectful environment - no console-war is allowed here :smiley: - creating a friendly and supportive local community.

Its idea came around with the release on the newest Nintendo game, Zelda Tears of The Kingdom, when our founding-member Joao could not find among his friends anyone who is a gamer to play or at least talk about it.

We do value our online gaming buddies, however, we also want to meet out buddies in person, come play with us!
